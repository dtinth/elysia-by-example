export default markdown`
In Bun, you can start a web server without having to explicitly call
the \`listen\` method â€” just \`export default\` an object that has a
\`fetch\` method.

When you run:

~~~sh
bun examples/00_wintercg/index.ts
~~~

You should see:

~~~
Started development server: http://localhost:3000
~~~
`;

export const tests = [
  defineTest({
    title: "Example request",
    request: {
      url: "/",
    },
  }),
];
